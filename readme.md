# Documentation

I got tired of writing documentation over and over again. So, I'm going to
leverage distributed version control to write it once, store it in one central
place, and distribute it to whoever wants a copy.

All documentation is my own creation unless otherwise noted. It has been created
over time while I was employed by any number of different companies. As such
some of the documentation is specific to practices at those companies and every
effort has been made to ensure that no secret or proprietary information is
disclosed as part of the documentation.
